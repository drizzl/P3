# P3 Project 3

##Live URL of Project 3

##Description
This project consists of two main features
* A Lorem Ipsum generator to display random text
* A User Profile generator to create user database entries

I used external packages for the Lorem Ipsum and user generation functionality. It was difficult to find a good user profile package that worked, so I cobbled together outputs from two different packages.

##Outside sources
I used three packages to do the legwork of the two functions.

* Joshtronic's LoremIpsum
    * https://github.com/joshtronic/php-loremipsum
* Nub's Random Name Generator
    * https://packagist.org/packages/nubs/random-name-generator
* Campo's User Agent
    * https://packagist.org/packages/campo/random-user-agent
    
I also liberally used images I found online. They are located:
